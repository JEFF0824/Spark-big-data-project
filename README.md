# Abstract
Managing the yield of wafer is one of the most important tasks to the semiconductor manufacturers. A lot of efforts for enhancing the yield of wafer have been conducted in both industries and academia. Thanks to the advance of IoT and data analytics techniques, huge amount of process operational data, such as indices of process parameters, equipment condition data, or historical data of manufacturing process, is collected and analyzed in realtime. In this project I will analyze the big data of Wafer manufaturing for troubleshooting and fault detection by using PySpark in several steps.

## Wafer processing introduction
Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most complex works that has hundreds of process steps, several kinds of wafers, machinery, re-entrant flow, and innumerable process parameters, so it takes few months for completing the whole processes accordingly. Also, since semiconductor manufacturing process is very sensitive on stream, yield management is one of the most important issues directly connected to survival of a company.Here I briefly introduced the manufacturing process of wafer.

- Wafer Manufaturing
Wafer manufaturing: 

  The profound process of fabricating silicon wafers with IC design by masks and semiconductors processing machine tools.
